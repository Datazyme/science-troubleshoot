These are my notes on creating this site
When setting up the repository in git, found repository already assigned:
    kuzminanastasia@Kuzmins-Mac-mini science-troubleshoot % git remote add origin https://github.com/Datazyme/science-troubleshoot.git
    error: remote origin already exists.
To show origin: git remote show origin
To remove origin: git remote remove origin
Repository created but other projects were magically moved into it already

Deleted github and local repository
Start again:
First type git init --- did not do this above -- this was mistake

dependencies:
npm i bcryptjs cloudinary cors dotenv express express-fileu
pload jsonwebtoken mongoose socket.io uuid
and npm i -D nodemon

add notes and 
# dependencies
/node_modules
    did not put gitignore in server folder
    did commit but did not yet push
    to undo commit before push: git reset HEAD~


To run file in node, type: node filename ie...node index.js

req.params = values captured from the URL path
Defined by :paramName in routes
Always a string
Used to fetch specific resources

When to use req.params

Use it when:
Identifying a specific resource
URLs like:
/users/:id
/posts/:id
/comments/:id
req.params.id → user ID from URL
req.params is an Express object that contains route parameters — values taken directly from the URL path.

Do not use it for:
Search filters → use req.query
Form submissions → use req.body
